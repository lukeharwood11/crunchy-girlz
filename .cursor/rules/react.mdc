# React Code

When writing react code, first look in the components directory to reuse components. If something can be reusable, split up a component into reusable pieces. Always examine file structure before writing.

For CSS, we use vanilla css which should accompany the file in which they are being applied (i.e. login.page.tsx should have a login.page.module.css), do NOT use tailwind or any other css library.

Don't use magic colors, use the ones in [style.css](mdc:client/src/style.css).
